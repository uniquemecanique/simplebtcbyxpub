Simple Bitcoin address generation by xpub (public key)

1. Installing requirements

	sudo apt update && apt install python3 python3-pip -y
	sudo apt-get install python3-pip
	pip3 install bitcoin
	pip install git+https://github.com/primal100/pybitcointools.git@master
	
	// if errors, you can try: bash requirements.sh (not tested!)

2. CLI python usage

	1. python3 btc_by_xpubindex.py
		Please enter your xpub: [YOUR-XPUB]
		Please enter the index number: [ANY-NUMBER]
		[output address]
		
	2. python3 list_by_xpub.py
	
		Please enter your xpub: [YOUR-XPUB]
		[outputs list of 100 btc addresses]
		
3. PHP usage

	1. if you dont have lamp (php, mysql) installed, use this simple line
		sudo apt install lamp-server^
	
	2. copy all files to your local server e.g. /var/www/html/
	
	3. simply create config database using
		bash create_config_db.sh
	enter your database's username, password and give a name to a new db
	
	4. configure 'db.php' file.
	enter database's username, password and name of created db
	
	5. goto localhost from ur favorite browser
	
	6. Index page will show first bitcoin address. Updating page will output next address.

	7. goto localhost/manual_input.php to manualy enter xpub and select address, you wanna see.
	!!! remember that 0 = first address !!!
	
	8. To use it for assignment personal address on user registration:
		1. edit index.php ; comment, or remove this line: echo $xpub_address;
		2. I guess, your index file should content anything other: you should rename source index.php, e.g. getbtc.php
			sudo mv index.php getbtc.php
		3. use require_once('getbtc.php'); in your registration file and $xpub_address should output a new address every time.
